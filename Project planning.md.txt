# Project Planning Document
Include this Markdown file in the "Management" folder of your git 
repository and edit it accordingly.
## List of tasks and high level modules
Based on your project design and prototype, make a list of the modules and 
tasks to do.
Here an example:
### Architecture
2 Layers:
*  DB
*  GUI
### Modules
*  Create
*  Edit / Delete
*  Search
### Tasks
*  Design GUI interface
*  Design/Choose database
*  Link database with GUI
This is just an example, your tasks should be more detailed.
## Gantt Chart
Assign concrete tasks to each team member and plan your time using a Gantt 
Chart.
## Research state of the art projects
Go online and search for open source projects written in Python that do 
what your team want to do.
Complete this table one row for each project. You should list at least one 
project for each team member (i.e. you should research at four different 
projects if your team has four team members)

You can now import Markdown table code directly using File/Paste table data... dialog.


If you have difficulties finding projects similar to your project, search 
for different projects
but related (similar games, CRUD projects for different business, data 
analysis for different data, etc... ). You can also search for projects 
written in another language that you master.
